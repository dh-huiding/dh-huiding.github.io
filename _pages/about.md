I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University's Center for Health and Wellbeing. My research focuses on demand and supply-side factors of health care utilization, especially in mental health care setting, and the role of public insurance in setting price, promoting new technology, and adjusting patients' and providers' behavior. <br/>
